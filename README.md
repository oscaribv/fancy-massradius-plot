# fancy-massradius-plot

##### Oscar Barragán, 2017
#### Last update, March 2023

This script creates a fancy mass vs radius plot similar to the one presented in [Barragán et al.,  2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...612A..95B/abstract) with exoplanet data taken from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html).

 
If you use this script to create a plot for your manuscript, plese cite [Barragán et al.,  2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...612A..95B/abstract), the NASA Exoplanet Archive paper ([Akeson et al., 2013, PASP, 125, 989](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/672273)), and the `astropy` papers following the most updated recomendations given [here](https://www.astropy.org/acknowledging.html).

If you include composition models given in the Jupyter notebook, please cite [Zeng et al., 2016](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/819/2/127).


##### Using TEPCAT

Older versions of this script used [TEPCAT](https://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/tepcat/) ([Southworth, 2011](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/417/3/2166/1093448)). These database is not supported anymore and for this reason we decided to move to use the NASA Exoplanet Archive instead.
